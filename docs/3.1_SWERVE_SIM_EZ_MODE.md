# Swerve Simulation: Simplified Swerve Simulation

This approach focuses on the ease of use, while maintaining a reasonably accurate model of the robot behavior.  Though the physics simulation is realistic enough to accurate mimic your drivetrain, the code used to meanipulate the simulated drivetrain is embeded into maple-sim for conviniency, and will be slighly different from the code running on your real robot.

## 0. Abstracting your drive subsystem

## 1. Creating a Simplified Swerve Simulation

The `SimplifiedSwerveDriveSimulation` instance owns and controls a `SwerveDriveSimulation`, just like how your user code controls the physical chassis.  According to commands sent by the user, it runs closed loops on the virtual drive/steer motors in the simulated drivetrain, mimicing the behavior of the real swerve.


```java
// create a swerve simulation instance according to previous documents
SwerveDriveSimulation swerveSimulation = new SwerveDriveSimulation(...);
// create a simplifed swerve simulation owning to the swerve simulation
SimplifiedSwerveDriveSimulation simDrive = new SimplifiedSwerveDriveSimulation(swerveSimulation);
```


 ## 2. Using the simulated drivetrain

 To utilize the `SimplifiedSwerveDriveSimulation` instance, we need to create a wrapper around it that implements the
